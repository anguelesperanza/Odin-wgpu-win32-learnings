# Odin-wgpu-learnings
Hello Hello, this is my repository for me to dump examples I create while learning WGPU in Odin in relation to win32. I am not an expert by any means, so any and all examples should be taken with the finest grain of salt. There is no staying how far this will go with examples; graphics programming is hard after all.
